![SystemSweep Screenshot](https://github.com/naix1337/SystemSweep/blob/main/cleaner1/01.png) SystemSweep is a simple yet effective cleaner tool designed for Windows operating systems. It helps you free up disk space by removing various types of unnecessary files and data that accumulate over time, improving system performance and reclaiming valuable storage.

## ‚ú® Features

SystemSweep provides a straightforward interface to clean common system junk files, including:

* **Temporary Files:** Deletes temporary files created by applications and the system.
* **Recycle Bin:** Empties the contents of your Recycle Bin.
* **Download Cache:** Clears cached files from downloads.
* **Thumbnail Cache:** Removes cached image thumbnails.
* **Error Reports:** Deletes accumulated Windows Error Reporting files.
* **Installer Temp:** Cleans up temporary files left behind by installers.
* **Store Cache:** Clears cache related to the Microsoft Store.
* **Windows Logs:** Removes old Windows log files.
* **Memory Dumps:** Deletes memory dump files created after system crashes.
* **Windows.old:** Helps remove the `Windows.old` folder (typically created after a Windows upgrade) to free up significant space.

The application also provides:
* **Statistics:** Shows total space to clean, last cleaned date, and if it's running as admin.
* **Progress:** A bar to indicate the cleaning process.
* **Settings, About, and Updates:** Dedicated sections for managing application settings, viewing information, and checking for updates.
